# Run in Docker

```
# Install docker and docker-compose first.
mvn clean package
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
# Go to http://localhost:33000/
# Gateway service and UAA should be registered in eureka.
# In browser, try http://localhost:33001/uaa/ping
# You supposed to get HTTP status 204.
# If it works, that means requests are proxying through gateway.
